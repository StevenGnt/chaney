## Chart your money !

## Introduction
This little app allows you to foresee your money speendings, considering your recurring incomes and spendings, etc ...

## Make it work
1. Create app/data/data.json file and fill it with your own use cases (see example.json in the app/data directory).
2. Run gulp in the top-level directory (you might want to adjust some settings in the tasks/config.json file)and access to the app via your server.

## TODOS
- Simulation feature
- Export the current configuration or find a way to save the data.json (server side)
- Load the configuration from the JSON file
- Inject the configuration everywhere it is required
- Sort lists

### Chart your money !

## Introduction
This app allows you to foresee your money speendings, considering your recurring incomes and spendings, etc ...

## Make it work
1. `npm install` (or `yarn`)
2. npm start (or `yarn start`)
3. Head to http://localhost:3000/ to use the app
4. Customize `src/mock/accounts.json` to your needs (example are provided in the files, this is temporary, before having a backend solution)

## Evolutions and TODOs
- Simulations
- Unsync accounts start date + visualization start date
- Backend (store configurations)
